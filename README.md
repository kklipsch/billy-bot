# Billy Bot

![billy-bot](billy-bot.png)

[billy](https://github.com/billyhandiii) has left me hanging once again.  Well fool me once shame on you, fool me can't be fooled again.  I'm going to replace Billy's most important skill, being able to pick the correct Simpson's screen cap for any occasion, with a bot so that I'll never be deserted again.

## The plan

- [x] Categorize a prompt into a Simpson's quotes in JSON format.
- [x] Send quotes to Frinkiac and get screen caps back
- [] Get screen cap text from Frinkiac and compare to input quote.  Big challenge is that frinkiac responds with lots of caps for the same scheme
- [] If any screen cap texts are good matches, select its image and return.

## Development

We attempt to keep the dev container up to date.
