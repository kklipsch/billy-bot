# Progress: Billy Bot

## What Works

As the project is in its initial development phase, the following components are currently working:

1. **Basic CLI Framework**:
   - Command-line parsing using Kong
   - Subcommand structure for Frinkiac functionality
   - Early prototype of Smee client for webhook testing
   - Environment variable loading from .env files
   - Logging setup with zerolog
   - Signal handling for graceful shutdown

2. **Project Structure**:
   - Go module setup with dependencies
   - Basic package organization
   - Command pattern implementation

## What's Left to Build

The following components and features are still pending implementation:

1. **Frinkiac Integration**:
   - API client for the Frinkiac service
   - Quote search functionality
   - Screen capture retrieval
   - Result formatting and presentation

2. **GitHub Integration** (Primary Goal):
   - GitHub API client for issues, tasks, and pull requests
   - Webhook handling for GitHub events
   - Comment formatting for GitHub responses
   - Authentication and permissions handling

3. **Prompt Categorization**:
   - Prompt analysis logic
   - Quote matching algorithms
   - Confidence scoring
   - Fuzzy matching and synonyms support

4. **Future Platform Integrations**:
   - Discord integration
   - Slack integration
   - Abstraction layer for supporting multiple platforms

5. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API interactions
   - End-to-end tests for command execution
   - Test fixtures and mocks

6. **Documentation**:
   - Usage instructions
   - API documentation
   - Example use cases
   - Contribution guidelines

## Current Status

The project is in the **early development phase**, with the basic structure and CLI framework in place. The focus is currently on implementing Step 1 as outlined in the README: categorizing a prompt into a Simpson's quote.

The example.json file suggests that some progress has been made on the Frinkiac integration, with the ability to search for quotes with confidence levels. However, this functionality may not be fully implemented or integrated into the CLI yet.

The main.go file shows that the command structure is in place, but the actual implementation of the commands (in the pkg directory) is still pending or in progress.

## Known Issues

As the project is in early development, there are several known issues and limitations:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**:
   - The core functionality of categorizing prompts into Simpson's quotes is still under development.
   - The GitHub integration is not yet implemented.
   - The Smee client is only an early prototype for webhook testing.

2. **Missing Tests**:
   - Test coverage is limited or non-existent at this stage.
   - No CI/CD pipeline is in place for automated testing.

3. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Limited documentation on how to use the application.
   - No API documentation for the Frinkiac and Smee functionality.

4. **Development Environment**:
   - The dev container mentioned in the README may not be fully up to date.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Concept
The project started with a humorous premise: replacing a human (Billy) who was unreliable in providing Simpsons screen captures with a bot that would consistently deliver appropriate references.

### Technical Approach
1. **Language Selection**: Go was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and strong concurrency support, which is well-suited for handling webhook events and API interactions.

2. **CLI Framework**: Kong was selected as the CLI parsing library due to its declarative, struct-based approach, which aligns well with Go's design philosophy.

3. **Logging Strategy**: Zerolog was chosen for structured logging, providing better log analysis capabilities compared to traditional logging approaches.

4. **Command Pattern**: The decision to use the command pattern for CLI interactions provides a clean separation of concerns and makes it easier to add new functionality in the future.

5. **External API Integration**: Rather than implementing screen cap selection from scratch, the project leverages the existing Frinkiac API, focusing on the prompt categorization and integration aspects.

### Ongoing Considerations

1. **API Integration Strategy**: The team is still evaluating the best approach for integrating with the Frinkiac API, considering factors like direct HTTP requests vs. client libraries and synchronous vs. asynchronous processing.

2. **Command Structure**: Decisions about the optimal command structure and options for the CLI are still being made, including parameters for the Frinkiac command and output format options.

3. **Error Handling**: The project is developing a consistent approach to error handling, focusing on user-friendly error messages and appropriate logging.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Considerations about response time targets, concurrency models, and resource usage constraints are ongoing.

### Future Direction

The project roadmap suggests a phased approach:
1. First, focus on the core functionality of categorizing prompts into Simpson's quotes.
2. Then, implement the GitHub integration for issues, tasks, and pull requests.
3. If successful, expand to include Discord and Slack integrations.
4. Finally, consider additional features like more sophisticated matching algorithms, caching, and potentially a web interface.

This incremental approach allows for early validation of the core concept before investing in more complex features and additional platform integrations.
