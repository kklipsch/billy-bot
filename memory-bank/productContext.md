# Product Context: Billy Bot

## Why This Project Exists

Billy Bot was created out of necessity and a touch of humor. The project originated from a recurring problem: relying on a person named Billy to provide appropriate Simpsons screen captures for various situations, only to be "left hanging" repeatedly. As the README humorously states: "billy has left me hanging once again. Well fool me once shame on you, fool me can't be fooled again. I'm going to replace Billy's most important skill, being able to pick the correct Simpson's screen cap for any occasion, with a bot so that I'll never be deserted again."

This project represents a practical solution to ensure that users always have access to the perfect Simpsons reference, regardless of human availability or reliability.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Dependency on Unreliable Human Resources**: Eliminates the need to rely on a specific person (Billy) for Simpsons references, who may not always be available or responsive.

2. **Consistency in Reference Quality**: Ensures consistent quality in the selection of Simpsons references, rather than being subject to a human's varying levels of attention or expertise.

3. **Immediacy of Response**: Provides immediate responses to requests for Simpsons references, rather than waiting for a human to respond.

4. **Scalability**: Can handle multiple requests simultaneously, unlike a single human who can only process one request at a time.

5. **Preservation of Cultural References**: Helps maintain and propagate Simpsons references in everyday communication, preserving this aspect of pop culture.

## How It Should Work

The Billy Bot system is designed to work through a simple yet effective process:

1. **Input Reception**: The system receives input in the form of prompts or situations that require a Simpsons reference. This primarily comes through GitHub issues, tasks, and pull requests, with future plans to support Discord and Slack.

2. **Prompt Analysis**: The system analyzes the prompt to understand its context, tone, and key elements that would make for a good Simpsons reference match.

3. **Quote Matching**: Using the analyzed prompt, the system searches for and identifies the most appropriate Simpsons quotes that match the situation. This is done with varying levels of confidence, allowing for multiple potential matches.

4. **Screen Cap Retrieval**: Once appropriate quotes are identified, the system queries the Frinkiac website (e.g., `https://frinkiac.com/?q=quote`) and parses the HTML response to extract the corresponding screen captures from the Simpsons episodes. Frinkiac is a website designed for humans, not an API, so the system needs to parse the HTML content.

5. **Response Delivery**: The system delivers the selected quotes and screen captures back to the appropriate platform:
   - For GitHub: Comments on issues, tasks, or pull requests
   - For future Discord integration: Messages in channels or threads
   - For future Slack integration: Messages in channels or threads

The Smee client serves as an early prototype for webhook handling, but the primary focus is on direct GitHub integration.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Effortless Interaction**: Users should be able to easily request and receive Simpsons references without complex commands or interfaces.

2. **Relevance and Accuracy**: The provided references should be highly relevant to the user's prompt and accurately represent the Simpsons content.

3. **Delight and Humor**: The system should provide references that bring delight and humor to the user, enhancing their communication or content.

4. **Reliability**: Users should trust that the system will consistently provide appropriate references, unlike the human alternative.

5. **Flexibility**: The system should accommodate various types of prompts and situations, from specific quote requests to more abstract scenarios that need a fitting Simpsons reference.

6. **Integration Capabilities**: For more advanced users or services, the system should offer easy integration options through webhooks and APIs.

## Target Audience

1. **GitHub Users**: Developers and teams who use GitHub for collaboration and want to enhance their issues, tasks, and pull requests with relevant Simpsons references.

2. **Discord and Slack Users** (future): Communities and teams who use these platforms for communication and would benefit from Simpsons references.

3. **Simpsons Enthusiasts**: People who appreciate and frequently use Simpsons references in their communication.

4. **Software Development Teams**: Teams looking to add humor and cultural references to their development process.

5. **Anyone Previously Dependent on Billy**: Those who previously relied on the human Billy for their Simpsons reference needs.

## Success Metrics

The success of Billy Bot as a product will be measured by:

1. **Accuracy Rate**: The percentage of prompts for which the system provides relevant and appropriate Simpsons references.

2. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from users on the quality and relevance of the provided references.

3. **Adoption Rate**: The number of users or services that adopt Billy Bot for their Simpsons reference needs.

4. **Reliability**: The system's uptime and consistent performance in providing references.

5. **Comparison to Human Alternative**: How the system compares to the human (Billy) in terms of response time, accuracy, and availability.
