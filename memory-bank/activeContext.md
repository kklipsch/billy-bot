# Active Context: Billy Bot

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the Billy Bot project is on implementing Step 1 as outlined in the README: **Categorizing a prompt into a Simpson's quote**. This is the foundational capability that will enable the bot to match user inputs with appropriate Simpsons references.

Key aspects of this work include:
- Developing the core logic for analyzing prompts
- Implementing the matching algorithm to find relevant Simpsons quotes
- Integrating with the Frinkiac API to retrieve corresponding screen captures
- Setting up the command-line interface for the Frinkiac functionality

## Recent Changes

As the project is in its initial development phase, the recent changes include:
- Setting up the basic project structure with Go modules
- Implementing the CLI framework using Kong
- Creating the command structure for Smee and Frinkiac functionality
- Setting up logging with zerolog
- Implementing context-based cancellation for graceful shutdown
- Adding environment variable loading with godotenv

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Complete the Frinkiac Integration**:
   - Implement the full API client for the Frinkiac service
   - Add quote search functionality
   - Implement screen capture retrieval

2. **Enhance Prompt Categorization**:
   - Develop more sophisticated matching algorithms
   - Implement confidence scoring for quote matches
   - Add support for fuzzy matching and synonyms

3. **Implement Webhook Handling**:
   - Complete the Smee client implementation
   - Add webhook event processing logic
   - Implement response generation for webhook events

4. **Add Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for API interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests for command execution

5. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Add detailed usage instructions
   - Document API interactions
   - Provide examples of common use cases

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### API Integration Strategy
Currently evaluating the best approach for integrating with the Frinkiac API:
- Direct HTTP requests vs. using a client library
- Synchronous vs. asynchronous processing
- Caching strategy for frequently requested quotes

### Command Structure
Deciding on the optimal command structure and options for the CLI:
- What parameters should be available for the Frinkiac command
- How to handle different output formats (text, JSON, etc.)
- Whether to add interactive mode capabilities

### Error Handling Strategy
Developing a consistent approach to error handling:
- How to present errors to users in a helpful way
- When to retry failed API requests
- How to log errors for debugging

### Performance Optimization
Considering performance aspects:
- Response time targets for quote matching
- Concurrency model for handling multiple requests
- Resource usage constraints

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Preference for clean separation of concerns
- Package structure that reflects the domain model
- Clear interfaces between components

### Error Handling
- Explicit error checking (Go style)
- Contextual error messages
- Appropriate logging at different levels

### Configuration Management
- Environment variables for configuration
- Sensible defaults with override capabilities
- Clear documentation of configuration options

### Command Design
- Consistent command structure
- Self-documenting help text
- Intuitive option naming

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Initial Observations
- The Frinkiac API provides a rich source of Simpsons content but requires careful integration
- Command-line tools benefit greatly from intuitive, well-documented interfaces
- Go's concurrency model is well-suited for handling webhook events

### Technical Challenges
- Matching natural language prompts to specific quotes requires balancing precision and recall
- Handling the variability in webhook payloads requires robust parsing and validation
- Ensuring consistent performance across different operating environments

### Successful Approaches
- Using structured logging from the start has improved debugging capabilities
- The command pattern provides a clean way to organize CLI functionality
- Context-based cancellation ensures proper resource cleanup

### Areas for Improvement
- More comprehensive documentation would benefit future development
- Additional test coverage would increase confidence in the codebase
- Better error messages would improve the user experience
