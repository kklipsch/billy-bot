# Active Context: Billy Bot

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the Billy Bot project is on implementing Step 1 as outlined in the README: **Categorizing a prompt into a Simpson's quote**. This is the foundational capability that will enable the bot to match user inputs with appropriate Simpsons references, with the primary goal of integrating with GitHub for issues, tasks, and pull requests.

Key aspects of this work include:
- Developing the core logic for analyzing prompts
- Implementing the matching algorithm to find relevant Simpsons quotes
- Integrating with the Frinkiac website to retrieve corresponding screen captures through web scraping
- Setting up the command-line interface for the Frinkiac functionality
- Preparing for GitHub integration as the first platform target

## Recent Changes

As the project is in its initial development phase, the recent changes include:
- Setting up the basic project structure with Go modules
- Implementing the CLI framework using Kong
- Creating the command structure for Frinkiac functionality
- Setting up a prototype Smee client for early webhook testing
- Setting up logging with zerolog
- Implementing context-based cancellation for graceful shutdown
- Adding environment variable loading with godotenv

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Complete the Frinkiac Integration**:
   - Implement web scraping functionality for the Frinkiac website
   - Add quote search functionality using URL queries (e.g., `https://frinkiac.com/?q=quote`)
   - Implement HTML parsing to extract screen captures from responses

2. **Develop GitHub Integration**:
   - Create GitHub API client for interacting with issues, tasks, and pull requests
   - Implement event handling for GitHub webhooks
   - Design response format for GitHub comments

3. **Enhance Prompt Categorization**:
   - Develop more sophisticated matching algorithms
   - Implement confidence scoring for quote matches
   - Add support for fuzzy matching and synonyms

4. **Add Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for API interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests for command execution

5. **Prepare for Future Platform Integrations**:
   - Design modular architecture to support Discord and Slack in the future
   - Document integration points for additional platforms
   - Create abstraction layers for platform-specific functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Web Scraping Strategy
Currently evaluating the best approach for interacting with the Frinkiac website:
- HTML parsing techniques and libraries
- Handling of website structure changes
- Rate limiting and respectful scraping practices
- Caching strategy for frequently requested quotes
- Error handling for failed requests or unexpected HTML structures

**Current Status**: We have implemented a client that successfully sends quote requests to Frinkiac (e.g., `https://frinkiac.com/?q=Everything%27s+coming+up+Milhouse%21`), but our HTML parsing logic is not correctly extracting the screen captures from the responses. The client includes debug logging to help diagnose the issue. We need to investigate the HTML structure of the Frinkiac website more carefully to fix the parsing logic.

### Command Structure
Deciding on the optimal command structure and options for the CLI:
- What parameters should be available for the Frinkiac command
- How to handle different output formats (text, JSON, etc.)
- Whether to add interactive mode capabilities

### Error Handling Strategy
Developing a consistent approach to error handling:
- How to present errors to users in a helpful way
- When to retry failed API requests
- How to log errors for debugging

### Performance Optimization
Considering performance aspects:
- Response time targets for quote matching
- Concurrency model for handling multiple requests
- Resource usage constraints

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Preference for clean separation of concerns
- Package structure that reflects the domain model
- Clear interfaces between components

### Error Handling
- Explicit error checking (Go style)
- Contextual error messages
- Appropriate logging at different levels

### Configuration Management
- Environment variables for configuration
- Sensible defaults with override capabilities
- Clear documentation of configuration options

### Command Design
- Consistent command structure
- Self-documenting help text
- Intuitive option naming

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Initial Observations
- The Frinkiac website provides a rich source of Simpsons content but requires careful HTML parsing
- Command-line tools benefit greatly from intuitive, well-documented interfaces
- Go's concurrency model is well-suited for handling webhook events

### Technical Challenges
- Matching natural language prompts to specific quotes requires balancing precision and recall
- Handling the variability in webhook payloads requires robust parsing and validation
- Ensuring consistent performance across different operating environments

### Successful Approaches
- Using structured logging from the start has improved debugging capabilities
- The command pattern provides a clean way to organize CLI functionality
- Context-based cancellation ensures proper resource cleanup

### Areas for Improvement
- More comprehensive documentation would benefit future development
- Additional test coverage would increase confidence in the codebase
- Better error messages would improve the user experience
