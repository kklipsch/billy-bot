# Project Brief: Billy Bot

## Project Overview

Billy Bot is a Go-based application designed to replace a human's (Billy's) skill of picking the correct Simpsons screen cap for any occasion. The bot aims to categorize prompts into appropriate Simpsons quotes and provide relevant screen captures, ensuring that users are never left without the perfect Simpsons reference.

## Core Requirements

1. **Prompt Categorization**: Analyze user prompts and categorize them into relevant Simpsons quotes.
2. **Screen Cap Selection**: Select the most appropriate Simpsons screen capture that matches the categorized quote.
3. **GitHub Integration**: Provide appropriate Simpsons screen captures for GitHub issues, tasks, and pull requests.
4. **Frinkiac Integration**: Interact with the Frinkiac website (a site designed for humans, not an API) to find and retrieve Simpsons scenes based on quotes.
5. **Platform Extensibility**: Design the system to support future integrations with platforms like Discord and Slack.

## Project Goals

1. **Reliability**: Create a bot that consistently provides appropriate Simpsons references, unlike the human counterpart who "leaves users hanging."
2. **Accuracy**: Ensure high accuracy in matching prompts to relevant Simpsons quotes and scenes.
3. **Ease of Use**: Develop a simple interface for users to interact with the bot.
4. **Extensibility**: Design the system to be easily extended with additional features or integrations in the future.

## Success Criteria

1. The bot successfully categorizes a wide range of prompts into appropriate Simpsons quotes.
2. The bot reliably selects relevant screen captures for the categorized quotes.
3. The bot integrates seamlessly with other services via webhooks.
4. The bot provides a better user experience than relying on a human (Billy) for Simpsons references.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Development of a Go-based application with CLI commands for GitHub and Frinkiac functionality
- Integration with the Frinkiac website for Simpsons scene retrieval (via web scraping)
- GitHub integration for issues, tasks, and pull requests
- Basic prompt categorization functionality
- Prototype webhook event handling via Smee (early prototype)

### Out of Scope (for initial release)
- Advanced natural language processing beyond basic prompt categorization
- User interface beyond CLI
- Full integration with Discord and Slack (planned for future releases)
- Automated deployment pipelines

## Timeline

The project is currently in the initial development phase, with Step 1 (categorizing a prompt into a Simpson's quote) in progress.

## Stakeholders

- Project developers
- End users who need Simpsons references
- Integration partners (services that may connect via webhooks)
